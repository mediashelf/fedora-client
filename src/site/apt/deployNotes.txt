Maven requirements
Maven version 3.0.0 (or greater) is required to support deployment of artifacts

+--
Snapshot release

+--
mvn clean javadoc:jar source:jar deploy
+--

Performing a release

+--
# if needed, add missing license headers
mvn license:format

mvn release:prepare -DdryRun
mvn release:clean && mvn release:prepare
mvn release:perform

+--

Release without generating site

+--
mvn release:perform -Dgoals=deploy
+--

Release from a tag (e.g. if a release fails after a tag has been generated 
and the pom versions have been incremented, there should be no need to 
perform a mvn release:rollback. Instead, perform the release from the tag.

+--
mvn release:perform -DconnectionUrl=scm:git:git://github.com/mediashelf/fedora-client -Dtag=fedora-client-0.1.7
+--

Release using a SOCKS proxy

+--
MAVEN_OPTS="-DsocksProxyHost=localhost -DsocksProxyPort=8000" mvn release:perform 
+--


Fixing a botched release

+--
# maven cleanup
mvn release:rollback

# delete the local tag maven release:prepare created
#	substitute "fedora-client-0.0.8" with the actual tag
git tag -d fedora-client-0.0.8

# delete the remote tag
git push origin :fedora-client-0.0.8

# find the commit you want to back to
git log --pretty=oneline

# reset local repo
git reset --hard thechecksum

# reset remote repo
git push origin +master
+--
